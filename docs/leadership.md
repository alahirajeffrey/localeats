## How would you onboard a junior engineer into this project?

I would start by introducing them to the system architecture and explain which each service and tool was chosen. I would then walk them through the codebase and walk them through the code. I would assign them small and specific tasks to build their confidence.

## What coding standards or PR review practices would you enforce?

I would ensure a clear and consistent naming convention for variables and functions as well as ensure a consistent coding style is used by everyone and would use tools like ESLint to ensure the style is followed. I would ensure PRs are small, descriptive and focused on specific issues for easier reviews. I would encourage respectful and constructive feedback during reviews.

## If given 2 more engineers, how would you divide responsibilities?

I would assess their strengths and delegate tasks based on their strengths while encoraging the developers to work on their percieved weaknesses.
